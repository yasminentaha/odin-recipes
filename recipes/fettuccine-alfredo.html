                    <li>1 garlic clove</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups of heavy cream</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>

                    <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp of Italian parsley (optional)</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to season the water. Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook according to package instructions.</li>
                    <li>In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream.</li>
                    <li>Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.</li>
                    <li>Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out</li>
                    <li>Garish with Italian parsley, if so desired.</li>
                </ol>
